## Introduction
  ```Automata-Operations-on-relations``` is a project written in Javascript , using Nodejs which is a JavaScript runtime. Based on *Chapter 6* of the lecture notes: *Automata theory , an algorithmic approach - Javier Esparza*  released on August 26 , 2017 , this project is constructed, concentrating  on implementing some algorithms of operations on relations. We haved 5 operations : *PROJECT ( on component 1 ) , PROJECT ( on component 2 ) , JOIN , POST, PRE*. We also implemented the NFA-to-DFA conversion , state minimization ( remove unreachable states , merge equivalent states ) to reduce the number of states.  
  In term of this project, we used examples in that above lecture notes to conveniently help you follow. 
## Installation
1. Download and install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).  
2. Download this project and extract the zip file.  
## Usage  
1. The .jff input files are in ```input``` folder, they are examples so you can replace them by others.  
2. Go into project folder by command line , then type ```npm install xml2js``` to create ```node modules``` folder and download ```xml2js``` library
2. Go into project folder by command line , then type ```node buildxml```
3. The .jff output files will be created in ```result``` folder , they will be opened automatically with JFlap.
